# The-Sushi-Bar-Problem

This problem is inspired from the book 'The Little Book of Semaphores' by Allen B. Downey.

The sushi bar problem: Imagine a sushi bar with 5 seats. If you arrive while there is an empty seat, you can take a seat immediately. But 
if you arrive when all 5 seats are full, that means that all of them are dining together, and you will have to wait for the entire party
to leave before you sit down. Puzzle: write code for customers entering and leaving the sushi bar that enforces these 
requirements.

Solution is arrived using semaphores in C.
